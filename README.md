# 🕵️‍♂️ Metadata Hunter

A powerful, Python-based digital forensics tool designed to extract EXIF metadata and GPS coordinates from images.

> **Note:** This tool features a "Social Engineering" interface designed to look like a standard Windows properties viewer, while performing automated local data collection in the background.

## ✨ Features

- **📍 GPS Geolocation:** Automatically extracts GPS coordinates and generates direct Google Maps links.
- **📷 Device Fingerprinting:** Identifies Camera Make, Model, and Software version.
- **💾 Stealth Archiving:** Automatically creates a hidden backup of analyzed images in a `cache_temp` directory (Proof of Concept).
- **🎨 Clean GUI:** Professional, non-intrusive interface built with Tkinter to mimic system utilities.
- **⚡ EXE Support:** Can be compiled into a standalone executable.
