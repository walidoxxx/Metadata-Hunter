# 🕵️‍♂️ Metadata Hunter

A powerful, Python-based digital forensics tool designed to extract EXIF metadata and GPS coordinates from images.

- **📷 Device Fingerprinting:** Identifies Camera Make, Model, and Software version.
- **💾 Stealth Archiving:** Automatically creates a hidden backup of analyzed images in a `cache_temp` directory (Proof of Concept).
